	|Introduction|
	+------------+

WriteRight is an alternative Android Input Method. Its magic is that it shrinks the 
virtual keys  in order to help the writer in composing text. It uses personalized 
predictions that are based on usage of the words as well as the time that these words
were typed.

Many thanks to Athanasios Dallas for the WriteRight illustration and to Dimitrios Kotsakos for
coming up with the idea of naming this product "WriteRight".

	|Future Work|
	+-----------+
	
I want to add the factor of place in my prediction algorithm, beacause our written communication is
partly associated with the place that we communicate. Also I want to record all the timestamps for every
word in order to produce predictions that are based also in the current time.
